// Contract guard for rule R2 of the ecosystem posture (heatsync repo,
// docs/ecosystem-posture.md): heatsync cosmetics never render inside a
// platform's NATIVE chat DOM. They belong to our own surfaces — the multichat
// overlay, profile cards, logs, the site.
//
// Why a test and not a comment: it is the structural reason our $5/mo paid tier
// doesn't strictly dominate a ~$4 7TV sub. Our paint builder is more expressive
// than their curated paint catalog, so if our paints also rendered in twitch's
// own chat there would be no reason left to pay 7TV — we'd be taking their
// revenue on their own surface. The boundary is the deal, not an unfinished
// feature, and painting a native row is a two-line change for anyone who hasn't
// read the doc.
//
// Source-level assertion on purpose: these scripts run in the host page at
// document_start/document_end and can't be imported.
