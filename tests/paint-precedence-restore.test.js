/**
 * Source-level regression guards for two secondary paint bugs found while
 * chasing the "painted username renders blank" investigation
 * (tests/mention-paint-double-anchor.test.js has the primary root cause).
 *
 * Both fixes live in src/multichat/main.js, a single non-module content
 * script — same rationale as tests/background-helpers.test.js and the
 * existing "structural invariant" tests in tests/paints.test.js for pinning
 * behavior in non-importable bundle scripts: assert directly against the
 * source text so a silent revert fails the suite instead of only showing up
 * as a live-DOM bug report again.
 *
 * BUG #2 — resolveMentionColor precedence stomp:
 *   resolveMentionColor resolves an unknown mentioned user's color async and
 *   repaints every visible `a.hs-mc-mention[data-username]` for them. Before
 *   the fix it only skipped elements with a 7TV paint (getMcPaintStyle(uid)),
 *   NOT a HeatSync paint. applyHsPaintToElement clears an element's inline
 *   `style` attribute when it applies a paint (so the class-based paint CSS
 *   isn't out-specificity'd by a leftover inline color) — if this async color
 *   resolve landed afterward, it silently re-added `a.style.color`, which
 *   DOES outrank the class again, stomping the paint back to a flat color.
 *
 * Item 3 — restored/cached rows never get a HeatSync paint:
 *   The "cache-restored fast path" (tab-switch-back / reload) mounts a
 *   previously-built DocumentFragment as-is, bypassing buildMessageDiv
 *   entirely — so paints that resolve AFTER a row was first built, or rows
 *   restored from a session where the paint was already cached, never get
 *   applyHsPaintToElement called on them. The existing code already
 *   re-applies 7TV cosmetics here (updateCosmeticsInPlace) but had no
 *   equivalent HeatSync-paint pass, since hsPaintCache is a separate cache
 *   from mcUserCosmetics.
