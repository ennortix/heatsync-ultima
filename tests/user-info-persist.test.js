/**
 * Regression: your IDENTITY must be written the moment it is fetched.
 *
 * The bug (2026-08-07): `fetchUserInfo()` computed a correct userInfo and then
 * only assigned it to a module global, `pendingUserInfoToPersist`. That global
 * reached disk in exactly ONE place — the Promise.all tail of `initialize()`.
 * So the two paths that matter most both dropped it:
 *   - login via cookies.onChanged  → fetched identity, never persisted
 *   - the popup's refresh_all      → fetched identity, never persisted
 * and a service-worker death threw it away.
 *
 * The resulting state is the nastiest kind: `auth_token_encrypted` PRESENT,
 * `user_info` ABSENT. Every signed-out affordance in the overlay tests the
 * token, so all of them stayed hidden; every mention/reply matcher reads
 * `user_info`, so nothing matched. No red mentions, no "replied to you", no
 * mention pings — and not one word on screen explaining why. Recovery was
 * incidental: whenever the service worker next cold-started AND all seven
 * parallel fetches happened to settle.
 *
 * Second half: on 401/403 the old code removed `user_info` but LEFT the token,
 * manufacturing that same silent state on every session expiry.
 *
 * background.js cannot be imported (top-level chrome.* listeners; see
 * tests/background-helpers.test.js), so per house pattern these are
 * marker-based source-text invariants that fail loudly on drift.
